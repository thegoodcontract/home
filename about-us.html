            <h2>ABOUT US</h2>
            We are a dedicated group of three female students who have invested significant effort into exploring the topic of mental health as part of our project. Fueled by our shared passion for design and our commitment to empowering women in the design industry, we have developed a website as a valuable tool. Our ultimate aim is to assist women in asserting their rights regarding working conditions while advocating for positive change.
            <br><br>Our website offers a unique feature that allows women in the design industry to create their individual employment contract. This tool allows them to define their specific needs and requirements in terms of working hours, workload, remuneration and other important aspects. Once the employment contract is created, it can be conveniently downloaded and used as a basis for negotiations with employers. We strongly believe that women should have the opportunity to shape their own working conditions and in this way advocate for a healthy and balanced working environment.
            <br><br> In addition to the employment contract feature, our website also provides a platform for testimonials from women in the design industry. We believe in the power of sharing and want to encourage women to share their stories. These testimonials serve to inspire other women to tackle challenges, stand up for their rights and bring about positive change in the industry. We believe that by sharing experiences, awareness of existing problems can be created while developing solutions.
            <br><br>We are proud to support women in promoting their mental health, improving their working conditions and strengthening their professional experiences. With our website we want to give women in the design industry a voice and support them to achieve their goals.
            <br><br>We invite all women in the design industry to visit our website, benefit from the resources provided, create their individual employment contracts and share their experiences with others. Together we strive for an industry that provides equal opportunities and supportive working conditions for all women.</p>
