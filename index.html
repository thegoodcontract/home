                "I had to work on my free day because I opened text and groupchat makes me laugh all the time",
                "I feel that I never have enough time to develop a reflective and a meditate decision. I have to have fast decisions and opinions and explain them the with a lot of confidence, is not well seen to have doubts, and for me doubts are necessary to well achieve the problem.",
                "66,7% feel that they can fulfil their wishes and goals at their workplace",
                "I feel like there’s a lot of space for improvement in terms of feedback and talking about topics in general. A lot of people hold back and don’t give their opinions",
                "52,4% rate their workload as high but adjustable",
                "I once worked for free for a high workload. It was the unhealthiest environment I have ever been in. I didn't know how to deal with it.",
                "In my current freelancing job, I work with a start-up that is completely inexperienced when it comes to working with designers. That's why I had to stand up for my rights in many moments and clearly communicate what works and what doesn't.",
                "Especially one situation where the feedback was crossing a lot of personal boundaries, like being shouted at for little reason.",
                "Decisions that were made together were later overturned",
                "sometimes it's chaos...",
                "I generally find it good when communication is low-threshold, direct and uncomplicated, for example via telegram or what's app. Especially when there is a lot to clarify. It's only stupid when it drifts into the unprofessional and communication is only on demand or too spontaneous and casual.",
                "Communication happens a lot between the students but not so much between students and professors. They are either hard to reach or intimidating because of unpredictable mood swings. I guess men get them too. But it totally depends on the person. Other professors are eager to help and to support wherever they can. Mail communication is good so far.",
                "Internally in teams, we communicate at eye level without having to follow formal rules, which I find very facilitating.",
                "I've encountered a couple of poorly handled situations, where communication or lack of effective communication has led to ground breaking misunderstandings and emotional breakdown of people who didn't deserve it. In these matters I've tried to introduce psychological techniques and ways of contention, aiming to develop more sensitivity when treating others regarding sensitive matters.",
                "I think you have to maintain stable and continuous communication, but without mixing more personal issues that make you feel like you are a family. This conditions when it comes to making decisions at work, you end up understanding your colleagues as if they were your real family, and any decision seems to be existential and has a lot of responsibility, when in reality they pay you a precarious salary and make you work extra days, where is the vision of family here on their part?  I think that for me a good communication is one that has clear human priorities and understands the work as it is, without deconfiguring it. It understands that workers have a life outside the office and a health that they have to take care of. At the same time, they value each worker for the work she does during the 8-hour working day, without judging her personal life or her identity.",
                "I said exactly what I thought of him! I told him that he was sexist and I ended up making a complaint. Everyone in my work place found out that I had made a complaint even the manager when it was suppose to be private. ( the head boss of friends with my manager, and told him)",
                "I don't feel comfortable with it, but I feel it's more efficient in critical board meetings where we must make important decisions.",
                "To stop saying sexist comments and sexist jokes",
                "It also has to do with the hierarchy in my company. It so happens that all the top managers are men, so their opinion carries more weight. This also has a bearing on the dynamism of any meeting, project, client... I always feel that I have to act according to the dynamics of relationships between men (understanding the old-fashioned view of gender as a social role).",
                "As my work is related to communication, there is a fine line between all things that involve my own work. It is difficult to separate what is your responsibility from what is not, and as creative projects often increase without enough resources (money and HR), the people who suffer these changes are us.",
                "A positive experience in terms of communication have been when people help eachother.",
                "Communication on eye-level, but my boss is a woman, and we are working in a team of two, and the communication is wonderful",
                "Easy communcation with the team and sometimes more difficult with people that has superior range",
                "We don't talk enough and don't meet enough, which leads to a lack of communication in the company."
